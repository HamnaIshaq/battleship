- study about the pub sub design pattern and try to add this in this project
- try to complete this project in this week (till 21-05-2023)

- THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND

- Write a test, then make it pass
- Try to seperate the app functionality from DOM manipulation
- You can use mocks to make sure that DOM methods like appendChild are being called, but try your best to keep those things outside of the app logic.

- PROJECT LOGIC
- A grid container
- multiple ships of varying sizes
  - ship length
  - number of times ship is hit()
  - ship has sunk of not isSunk()
